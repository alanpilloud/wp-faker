# WP-Faker

WP-Faker is a small tool to generate WordPress content really quickly ! More than that, you can add Acf fields too !

It's based on Fran√ßois Zaninotto's [Faker PHP library](https://github.com/fzaninotto/Faker).

## Why?

I needed a small tool to seed my WordPress installations when developping new themes for customers. Having to manually write into each fields of some posts containing a lot of acf fields is such a pain...

That's why I did this tool which allows me to specify which post type I want to populate and assign dummy values to each fields.

By the way, WP-Faker works without Acf too.

## Installation

Just clone the project at the root of your wordpress install and install Faker with composer :

```
git clone https://github.com/alanpilloud/wp-faker.git
cd wp-faker
composer install
```

## Usage

All you have to do is editing the file config-sample.php to suit your needs and browse the wp-faker folder.

If you are curious about what type of data you can generate, visit the [Faker PHP library](https://github.com/fzaninotto/Faker), there is a full documentation on this page.

Then, browse to `http://yourdomain.com/wp-faker`. A preview of what you are going to generate is displayed. If you are satisfied with your configuration, then click on __Ok, let's go!__ to generate your first post.

The new post has been created, you can now create a new one or go back to the preview.

### Multiple configurations

If you need to run more than one configuration, make a new config file at the root
of your WP-Faker installation. It must be named after this pattern :

```
config-***name***.php
```

Then copy paste the content of config-sample.php and start editing. You will be able
to choose which file to use in the footer of the "ready" page.

### Flex content fields

To use flex content fields, you can't use the system name of the field. You will need
to use the field_key (you know, this kind of key : field_5641e6b5d1167)

### Cleaning the website of the dummy content

Wp-Faker adds a user named WpFakerUser. To remove all the dummy content (images too), simply delete the user and specify that you don't want to keep its content.

## Don't use it on your production server

This tool is meant to be used only for development, don't let anybody pollute your website !

## Todo
WP-Faker is still under developement and here is what I will have to do :
 - Pre-generate the $value array regarding the actual Acf config.
 - Being more userproof.
